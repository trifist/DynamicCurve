# DynamicCurve
This is an android project used to show the volumn of sound recorded by android devices.

You can modify the parameters between line 34 and line 44 in the class called CurveView to adjust the shape of the curve. The function used to generate the curve can be found in the java method at line 207 in the same class.

Hope it helps!
